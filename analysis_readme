During my analysis of the data provided in the movie data CSV file it shows the Top 10 popular movies have a budget of at least $20million, 
these movies are from genres and are not specific one age group. These top 10 popular movies exceeded their budget in revenue sales. 
The revenue sales are based on total domestic ticket sales. Reason the top 10 popular films is because the use of the best quality 
CIG graphics for amination. The animation brings the characters to life, giving the audience better sense of the story. 
Lastly, what led to the success of these films is being released during times that other major movies were not released. 
This allows for more viewership for the film during the release. 

The difficulties associated with this challenge was trying to import the files into SQL. 
The exporting the flies a bit time consuming to do at first, however once I was able to set the variables correctly, 
I was able to move the data with ease. Once uploaded in SQL to save and submit the assignment on time I limited my tables to the 500 films and ratings.
Going forward knowing that importing can take time to upload I will allow myself enough time to create the tables and interpreting the data.
